# Arsenic 2
**A simple tool to encrypt files and texts with strong algorithms.**<br>
Tested with Windows 10 and all major Linux distributions. Arsenic is developed on Archlinux.

*More screenshots at the and of this readme.*

## Simple Description: ##
Arsenic was intended as a lightweight, portable application, that would encode a list of local files using a pass-phrase. A simple text editor named "CryptoPad" can be useful for send encrypted text by email. CryptoPad and file encryption always use cascade triple encryption with this algorithms:
- [XChaCha20Poly1305](https://botan.randombit.net/handbook/api_ref/cipher_modes.html#chacha20poly1305)
- [AES256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)/[EAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAX_mode)
- [Serpent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(cipher))/[GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)

Some useful tools are included. A file Hash calculator and a password generator.

## Technical description: ##
**Arsenic encrypted file format**<br>
A 96 bytes "Masterkey" is generated by Argon2 from the user pass-phrase and a 16 bytes (128 bits) random salt. This "Masterkey" is split in 3 32 bytes keys for encrypt in cascade the header. The  header contain the random 96 bytes "internal_key" and the original file name. The data of original file are encrypted in cascade with the random "internal_key" split in three.

the output is :
- MAGIC_NUMBER
- APP_VERSION
- Argon memlimit
- Argon iterations
- original fileSize
- original fileNameSize
- Argon salt  (16 bytes)
- ivChaCha20  (24 bytes)
- ivAES       (24 bytes)
- ivSerpent   (24 bytes)
- encrypted header  (32 bytes internal_key1 + 32 bytes internal_key2 + 32 bytes internal_key3 + original fileName + 16 bytes Mac * 3)
- encrypted file (original fileSize + 16 bytes Mac * 3)

Notes:<br>
ivChaCha20, ivAES and ivSerpent, the three nonces (or initialization vector) used for encrypt the header are incremented for encrypt the file to ensure they are never reused with the same key.<br>
The encryption is optimized for big files. Arsenic read and encrypt chunk by chunk.

**Text encryption with cryptopad**<br>

- A 96 bytes Master key is generated by Argon2 from the user pass-phrase and a 16 bytes (128 bits) random salt
- The master key is split in three 32 bytes keys. Key1, Key2, Key3
- A random 72 bytes master nonce (or initialization vector) is generated
- The random nonce is split in three 24 bytes nonces and write it
- write a version code
- write the salt
- the clear text is encrypted by ChaCha20Poly1305 with Key1 and nonce 1
- the output is encrypted by AES-256/EAX with key2 and nonce 2
- the output is encrypted by Serpent/GCM with key3 and nonce 3

**Hash calculator**<br>
Supported algorithms: SHA-3, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512-256, Skein-512, Keccak-1600, Whirlpool, Blake2b, SHAKE-128, SHAKE-256, GOST-34.11, SM3, Tiger, Streebog-256, Streebog-512, RIPEMD-160, Adler32, MD4, MD5, CRC24, CRC32

## Command line mode: ##
**The command line interface doesn't support space in the arguments.**
This example encrypt a file named "test.mkv" with the secret passphrase "badpassphrase". Encryption produce the encrypted file "test.mkv.arsenic" but it can be renamed because the original file name is encrypted in the file.

```bash
    ./arsenic -e -p badpassphrase -n test.mkv
    # For decrypt this file :
    ./arsenic -d -p badpassphrase test.mkv.arsenic
    # View help :
    ./arsenic -h
    # View Arsenic version :
    ./arsenic -v
```

## Developers: ##
The application was primarily built around the Qt 5.14 framework.
To update Botan, you must regenerate the amalgamation build from source:

```bash
    # for linux clang
    ./configure.py --cc=clang --amalgamation --disable-shared --disable-modules=pkcs11
    # for linux gcc
    ./configure.py --cc=gcc --amalgamation --disable-shared --disable-modules=pkcs11
    # for Windows MinGW x86
    python configure.py --cpu=x86_64 --cc=gcc --os=mingw --amalgamation --disable-shared --disable-modules=pkcs11
    # for Windows MinGW x32
    python configure.py --cpu=x86_32 --cc=gcc --os=mingw --amalgamation --disable-shared --disable-modules=pkcs11
```

To build the program from source, the appropriate Qt version should be installed and configured for the target platform, including any tools such as Qt Creator.<br>
Arsenic work well but it need some code simplifications, code comments, orthographic corrections ,etc.<br> Any suggestions or help are welcome.

## CAUTION: ##
A simple tool to encrypt file is not magic. If You use an insecure system, Arsenic (and all encryption tools) are useless. Arsenic do not protect you from key-logger, disk analyze, virus, vignetting cache etc...
