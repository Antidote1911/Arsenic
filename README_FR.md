# Arsenic
**A simple tool to encrypt files or folders with strong algorithms.**

Originally forked from [QtCrypt](https://github.com/trashctor/QtCrypt) published in 2015 by [trashctor](https://github.com/trashctor).<br>
https://github.com/trashctor/QtCrypt<br>

- Updated from Qt4 to Qt5
- Switch from old [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium "Strong cryptographic library") version to [Botan](https://botan.randombit.net/ "Strong cryptographic library").
- Key derivation is now calculated by [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)
- Authenticated encryption algorithm is now [XChaCha20Poly1305](https://botan.randombit.net/handbook/api_ref/cipher_modes.html#chacha20poly1305)
- Support GUI mode and command-line mode
- Options and configuration
- Password generator
- Hash calculator :
<em>(Md4, Md5, Sha1, Sha224, Sha256, Sha384, Sha512, Sha3_224, Sha3_256, Sha3_384, Sha3_512, Keccak_224, Keccak_256, Keccak_384, Keccak_512)</em>

## Description: ##
Arsenic was intended as a lightweight, portable application, that would encode a list of local files and directories using a symmetric-key algorithm. One of the main goals was to keep things as simple and convenient as possible so that the encryption and decryption could be done on a daily basis, safeguarding data in the event of a lost device.

## Command line mode: ##
**The command line interface doesn't support space in the passphrase.**
Encrypt a file named "test.avi" with the secret passphrase "mysuperbadpassphrase". Encryption produce the encrypted file "test.avi.arsenic" but it can be renamed because the original file name is encrypted in the file.

```bash
    ./arsenic -e -p mysuperbadpassphrase test.mkv
```

  For decrypt this file :
```bash
    ./arsenic -d -p mysuperbadpassphrase test.mkv.arsenic    
```
View help :
```bash
    ./arsenic -h    
```
View Arsenic version :
```bash
    ./arsenic -v    
```


## Technical description: ##
- First, the file or directory is zipped
- A master 256 bits Master key is generated by Argon2 from pass-phrase and a 128 bits random salt
- A 128 bits initial random nonce (or initialization vector) is generated
- Write in the encrypted file a "magic number"
- Write in the encrypted file the version of Arsenic
- Write Argon2 parameters (memory limit, iterations, salt)
- Write the initial nonce
- Write the encrypted original file name and file size
- Write all the encrypted chunks

The initial nonce is incremented before all encryption operation to ensure it is never reused with the Master key.

## Developers: ##
The application was primarily built around the Qt 5.13.2-1 framework. Other dependencies include QuaZIP 0.8.1, zlib 1.2.11, used for zipping and unzipping directories, and Botan 2.12. Since these libraries do not depend on anything besides Qt, they should theoretically compile on any platform that Qt supports.

To build the program from source, the appropriate Qt version should be installed and configured for the target platform, including any tools such as Qt Creator.

## CAUTION: ##
A simple tool to encrypt file is not magic. If You use an unsecure system, Arsenic and all encryption tools are useless. Arsenic do not protect you from key-logger, disk analyze, virus, vignetting cache etc...
