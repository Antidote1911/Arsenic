Arsenic: Strong files encryption
==================================================

Arsenic is a cryptography application written in C++11 with Qt5, the fantastic crypto library `Botan
<https://botan.randombit.net/>`_, and Argon2, the password-hashing function that won the Password Hashing Competition (PHC). It is released under the `GPL-3.0
<https://github.com/Antidote1911/Arsenic/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ license.

The user can choose to use ChaCha20Poly1305, AES-256/GCM, or Serpent/GCM to encrypt. The decryption routine automatically detect the good Algorithm.

The hash-calculator and the encryption/decryption are optimized for big files.
